# Deploy a static website on AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting **static websites** that only include **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** that **require no server-side processing**. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you will **create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies**. Next, you will **upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront**. Lastly, you will **access** your **website** in a browser **using** the **unique S3 endpoint**.
